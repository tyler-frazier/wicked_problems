Tyler Frazier  
Lecturer of Interdisciplinary Studies  
Data Science Program  
William & Mary  

Welcome to my William & Mary webpage! I am a Lecturer of Interdisciplinary Studies in the Data Science program, where the central focus of my research and teaching is upon geospatial human development processes.   I teach two courses at William & Mary, Wicked Problems and Evolving Solutions (Human Development & Data Science), where I introduce students to interpreted programming languages (primarily R & LaTeX) as the means to describe, analyze, model, simulate and communicate the results from their exploratory investigations into the dimensions of global human development.
