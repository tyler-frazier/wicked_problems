#### Selim Jahan, Director of UNDP’s Human Development Report Office
What is Human Development?
#### Hans Rosling, Gapminder
The Best Stats You’ve Never Seen

#### Question

Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development.  Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live.  What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world?  Elaborate further on Jahan's definition of human development.  What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries' average achievement?

Hans Rosling states that "we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change" and proceeds to provide several examples.  What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth?  What was Rosling's warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?
