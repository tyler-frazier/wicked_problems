# Course Description  

This course provides an introduction to critical, ethical, and moral issues surrounding data and society. It blends social and historical perspectives on data with ethics, policy, and case examples—from text analytics to self-driving cars—to help students develop a workable understanding of current ethical and moral issues in data science. The course examines the ethics and morality of studying human subjects, documenting workflows, and communicating results. Students debate issues surrounding privacy, surveillance, discrimination, transparency, responsibility, and trust throughout the data lifecycle –from collection and creation to storage and analysis to the application and sharing of data. Pre-requisite(s): None

# Goals and Objectives:
- To learn about the research process and how it can be used to build a knowledge base to support your writing.
- To investigate a subject matter by defining its boundaries, identifying significant contributing areas of interest and discarding non-essential and/or non-contributing information.
- To use a body of knowledge as the basis for writing a research paper, including the formulation of a central research question
- To produce a scientific article, including a literature review, methodological discussion, citations, bibliography, abstract and information about the author.
- To challenge students to become apprentice scholars and identify a central research focus of interest.
