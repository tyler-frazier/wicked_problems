Course Attribute:   
Title: Applied Machine Learning  
Credit Hours: 3

Date Range: Jul 06,2020 - Aug 07,2020  

# Course Description

This course will focus on the technical application of machine learning algorithms, their nature, and discussions regarding the potential drawbacks and advantages of different classes of algorithms. Students entering into this course should have, at a minimum, a background in python and linear algebra. No single algorithm will be covered in great depth, and the course will place a focus on the code and implementation choices necessary for each class of algorithm. Topics covered will include data processing, regression in ML, decision trees, forests, k-nn, support vector machines, kernel SVM, k-means and hierarchical clustering, association rules, natural language processing, neural networks, and various associated approaches.Pre-requisite(s): (DATA 141 OR DATA 140 OR CSCI 140 OR CSCI 141) AND (DATA 146 OR CSCI 146)

# Goals and Objectives:
- To provide students with a critical understanding of the variety of tools that can be used for machine learning.
- To develop students ability to communicate findings, analysis, and visualization skills for future courses (and jobs).
- To expose students to real-world problems that are being engaged with by contemporary problem solvers and decision makers.
